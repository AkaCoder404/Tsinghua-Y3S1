review 项目 proposal 

## Perception: sensing the world

sensors: structures and physics

physics: vision is the subjective sensation obtained by coding and analyzing the peripheral sensory organs (eyes) of the visual system to reacieve the electromagnetic wave stimulation within a certain wavelength range in the external environment.

physical: vision, sound, touch (cones and colors)

chemical: smell, taste, pain 

visual perception

- searching for patterns, third dimension, stereopisis (monocular cues)

## Cognition: attention to the world 

cognative conscious and cognitive unconscious

- the mental abilities (cognitive engineering: cognetics, we must master an ergonomics of the mind if we want to design interfaces that are likely to work well)
- attention, learning, remembering, and forgetting

properties of cognitive conscious and cognitive unconscious

locus/focus of attention,

- formats of habits
- singularity of the locus of attention

## The Human Information Processor

three subsystems: perceptiual system, motor system, cognitive system

parameters of subsystem

- memory: storage capacity, decay time, main code type (physical, acoustic, visual, semantic)
- cycle time:
