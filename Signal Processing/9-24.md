# 信号的基本运算

## 常规运算
- 四则运算 The value of the signal after the four arithmetic operations at any point is defined as the result of the same arithmetic operation on the original signal at the same point.

 > There's not particularly any "physical" meaning to the convolution operation. The main use of convolution in engineering is in describing the output of a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system. The input-output behavior of an LTI system can be characterized via its impulse response, and the output of an LTI system for any input signal x(t) can be expressed as the convolution of the input signal with the system's impulse response

- Instead of finding the area of the intersecting part of the graph, is the area of the multiplication result function
- During the t-axis sliding process of the unfolded signal of a signal, the area of the new signal obtained by multiplying the coincident part of another signal with tao is the waveform of the convolution of the two signals to be sought.
