# 计算机网络安全 【实验1】 课件

## 本实验：基础网络环境搭建

- Device, Password, Route

## 构成网络的基本元素

> a subnet represents network segments within the IP space defined by a larger network. the IP is the method for sending data from one computer to another over the internet. Each computer, or host, on the internet has at least one IP address as a unique identifier. Organizations will often use a subnet to spilt a large networking into a grouping of interconnected networks to help minimize traffic. This way, traffic doesn't have to flow through unnecessary routes, increasing networks speeds.

Resource subnet: can access and supply data

- PC, server, work station

Communication subnet: used to connect resources and transfer data

- Repeater, hub, bridge, switch, router

## CISCO Packet Tracer

powerful network simulation application

has a variety of different routers, switches, terminal equipment, connecting lines, etc

## 交换机 Switch

> network switch is a small device that centralizes communications among several connected devices in one LAN, A switch determines the source and destination address of each packet and forwards data only to the specific devices.

- data link layer (layer 2 switch) of OSI model
- exception: multilayer switches can work at the network layer / transport layer 
- prover undistributed connections at both ends of communication 

如何连接交换机

- connection line, 直通双绞线（straight through），交叉双绞线（crossover）
- 8 pins, different purposes when connecting to different things
- PC-PC 1，2 发送， 3，6接受
- PC-Switch: 
  - PC: 1,2发送，3,6接收
  - Switch: 1,2接受，3,6发送

## 路由器 Router

> responsible for receiving, analyzing, and forwarding data packets among the connected computer networks. When a data packet arrives, the router inspects the destination address, consults its routing tables to decive the optimal route and transfers the packet along this  route.

- network layer of OSI model
- route selection depends on delay, cost, and route management
- 路由表 (RIB)  handles management, routing protocols, ... configuration
- 转发表 (FIB) handles the actual port fowarding

## CISCO IOS 工作模式

User Mode, Router>
Priviliged Mode， Router#
Global Configuration Mode, Router(config)#
Special Configuration Mode, Router(config-mode)#

## 基础配置

```
?
(config) hostname
# show running-config, show startup-config
# copy running-config, copy startup-config
# show ip interface brief
# show ip route
interrupt: Ctrl + shift + 6
```

## 密码配置

设置console/telnent登录密码

```
line [console/vty] [number]
password 
login
```

设置进入特权模式的密码

```
(config)# enable password(密码为铭文显示)
enable secret (密码为密文(cypher text)显示)
```

接口状态

```
(config)# shutdown
(config)# no shutdown (device interface initial starting status is down)
```

## IP地址配置

```
(config-interface)# ip address [ip][mask]
192.168.1.188/24
network number, host number
(config-interface)# no ip address
```

IPv4 reserved address （private ip addresses)

```
Type A: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
Type B: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
Type C: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
```

## ICMP 

> supporting protocol in the internet protocol suite. It is used by networking devices to send error messages, and operation information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address.

Ping, unreachable, timeout

Traceroute/tracer, ICMP Echo Request, ICMP Echo Reply

## 静态路由配置

tell the router which interface to choose when deciding to route traffic to a specified destination

default route, ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0

``` 
(config)# ip route [prefix] [mask] [interface]
(config)# no ip route [prefix] [mask] [interface]
```

## Extra

Subnet Mask

> IP address are grouped by something called subnet mask. Every ip address has a corresponding subnet mask. The subnet mask specifies the range of the ip addresses in a group. 

192.168.1.0 - Subnet Address
192.168.1.1 - usually the gateway

192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4
192.168.1.5
192.168.1.6
...
192.168.1.252
192.168.1.253
192.168.1.254
192.168.1.255 - Broadcast Address

> every group of ip addresses has a subnet address, broadcast address, and gateway. both the subnet address, ip address, and the broadcast address are used to send information to every ip address in the group. 

The gate way acts as the groups controller.

- for instance, if our computer on the ip address of 192.168.1.3 wanted to send information to the internet, our computer sends data to the gateway.
- the gateway can be on any ip address in the range. Usually it is on the second ip address in the range, or the second ip address from the end of the range. The Subnet Address is always on the first ip address in the range, and the Broadcast Address is always on the last one in the range.

> the gateway is a single component of networking hardware system applied in the field of telecommunication for the interaction of devices, that enable the data flow from one discrete network to others. It act as routers or switches that are capable of interacting with multiple networks and can work on seven layers of the [OSI model](https://www.educba.com/what-is-osi-model/).

## Definition - What does *Virtual Teletype (VTY)* mean?

Virtual teletype (VTY) is a command line interface (CLI) created in a router and used to facilitate a connection to the daemon via Telnet, a network protocol used in local area networks. To connect to a VTY, users must present a valid password.
